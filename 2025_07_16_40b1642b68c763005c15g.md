### 3.2 Required engine output for ice classes IA Super, IA, IB and IC

The engine output shall not be less than that determined by the formula below and in no case less than $1,000 \mathrm{~kW}$ for ice class IA, IB and IC, and no less than $2,800 \mathrm{~kW}$ for IA Super.

### 3.2.1 Definitions

The dimensions of the ship and some other parameters are defined as follows:

| $L$ | m | the length of the ship between the perpendiculars |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Lbow | m | the length of the bow |
| Lpar | m | the length of the parallel midship body |
| $B$ | m | the maximum breadth of the ship |
| $T$ | m | the actual ice class draughts of the ship according to 3.2.2 |
| $A_{w f}$ | $\mathrm{m}^{2}$ | the area of the waterline of the bow |
| $\alpha$ | degree | the angle of the waterline at $B / 4$ |
| $\varphi_{1}$ | degree | the rake of the stem at the centerline |
| $\varphi 2$ | degree | the rake of the bow at $B / 4$ |
| $\psi$ | degree | the flare angle calculated as $\psi=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{\tan \phi}{\sin \alpha}\right)$ using local angles $\alpha$ and $\varphi$ at |
| DP | m | the diameter of the propeller |
| $H_{M}$ | m | the thickness of the brash ice in mid channel |
| $H_{F}$ | m | the thickness of the brash ice layer displaced by the bow |

### 3.2.2 New ships

To qualify for ice class IA Super, IA, IB or IC, a ship the keel of which is laid or which is at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 September 2003 shall comply with the following requirements regarding its engine output. The engine output requirement shall be calculated for
