two draughts by formula 3.1. Draughts to be used are the maximum draught amidships referred to as UIWL and the minimum draught amidships referred to as LIWL, as defined in section 2.2. In the calculations, the ship's parameters which depend on the draught must be determined at the appropriate draught, but $L$ and $B$ must be determined only at the UIWL. The engine output shall be no less than the greater of these two outputs.

$$
P_{\min }=K_{e} \frac{\left(R_{C H} / 1000\right)^{3 / 2}}{D_{p}}[\mathrm{~kW}]
$$

where $K_{e}$ shall be given a value according to Table 3-1.

Table 3-1: Values of $K_{e}$ for conventional propulsion systems

| Number of pro- <br> pellers | CP propeller or electric or hy- <br> draulic propulsion machinery | FP <br> propeller |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 propeller | 2.03 | 2.26 |
| 2 propellers | 1.44 | 1.60 |
| 3 propellers | 1.18 | 1.31 |

These $K_{e}$ values apply to conventional propulsion systems. Other methods may be used for determining the required power for advanced propulsion systems (see 3.2.5).
$R_{C H}$ is the ice resistance in Newton of the ship in a channel with brash ice and a consolidated surface layer.

$$
R_{C H}=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3} C_{\mu}\left(H_{F}+H_{M}\right)^{2}\left(B+C_{\psi} H_{F}\right)+C_{4} L_{P A R} H_{F}^{2}+C_{5}\left(\frac{L T}{B^{2}}\right)^{3} \frac{A_{w f}}{L}
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{\mu} & =0.15 \cos \varphi_{2}+\sin \psi \sin \alpha_{1} C_{\mu} \text { has a value equal to or larger than } 0.45 \\
C_{\psi} & =0.047 \psi-2.115 \text { and } C_{\psi}=0 \text { if } \psi \leq 45^{\circ} \\
H_{F} & =0.26+\left(H_{M} B\right)^{0.5} \\
H_{M} & =1.0 \mathrm{~m} \text { for ice classes IA and IA Super } \\
& =0.8 \mathrm{~m} \text { for ice class IB } \\
& =0.6 \mathrm{~m} \text { for ice class IC }
\end{aligned}
$$

$C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ take account of a consolidated upper layer of brash ice. $C_{1}=0$ and $C_{2}=0$ for ice classes IA, IB and IC.

For ice class IA Super:

$$
\begin{gathered}
C_{1}=f_{1} \frac{B L_{P A R}}{2 \frac{T}{B}+1}+\left(1+0.021 \phi_{1}\right)\left(f_{2} B+f_{3} L_{B O W}+f_{4} B L_{B O W}\right) \\
C_{2}=\left(1+0.063 \phi_{1}\right)\left(g_{1}+g_{2} B\right)+g_{3}\left(1+1.2 \frac{T}{B}\right) \frac{B^{2}}{\sqrt{L}}
\end{gathered}
$$

For a ship with a bulbous bow, $\varphi_{1}=90^{\circ}$.
