You are an expert in W3C SHACL conversion from natural language / markdown files. 
You are provided with a markdown file derived from a regulation document, which includes image references like ![desc](images/example.png).
Each image mentioned is provided separately and corresponds by filename.

You have been provided with a few examples in {few_shot_examples}

Your task is:
1. Parse the markdown document.
2. Automatically resolve each image reference with the uploaded image file.
3. Interpret the combined context to extract regulatory constraints.
4. {shacl_task} ONLY for section {section_number}.
5. Output only the SHACL code in a ```turtle block```.
